# when the ball hit more brick in compo make the hit sound pitch higher
# add more songs

ROADMAP:
- clean the code
- write the todos here

    - ask for a name in the start of the program
    - select play
- go back to main menu
- add leaderboard to main menu

- add co op mode
- add time mode (and leaderboard)

- 1 vs 1

# effects:
# Rotate brick particle effects
# Ball trail effects
# make the ball shining (with pulse)
# Particle sparks on ball bounce
# pulse animation to the bricks

# Control customization
# Statistics tracking:
    for each mode (and total):
        - brick brock
        - hit wall
        - hit celling
        - hit paddle
        - average score
        - highest score
        - time played
        - total games played
        - each powerup pick timed
        - clears
        - Longest game session (for score based)
        - Fastest clear completion
        - Most balls active simultaneously
        - Total balls lost
        - Longest ball rally
        - Powerup utilization rate

    - only for 1 vs 1 multiplayer (Win/loss ratio)

# multiple resolutions?

# powerups:
# Multi-Ball, Fire Ball - Ball breaks through multiple bricks without bouncing, Sticky Ball - Ball sticks to paddle, letting player aim shots, Giant Ball, small Ball
# Extend Paddle, Shrink Paddle, Laser Paddle, Double Paddle - Creates a second paddle above the main one, Color Burst - Destroys all bricks of the same color,
# Column Clear - Destroys entire vertical column, Shield Bottom - Creates temporary barrier below paddle
# Extra Life - Gives player additional life, Point Multiplier - Doubles points for limited time, Ball change - Make the ball faster, Brick Shuffle - Rearranges remaining bricks
# Gold Brick - Requires multiple hits but gives bonus points

# maybe:
- Explosive Ball
# probably not
- Ghost Ball - Ball passes through specific colored bricks

how to implement the features:
game modes:
-   "normal"
-   timed
    just like normal but also check time.
    like normal but display also the time in the text
    save to different scoreboard
-   co op
    just like normal but with two paddles
-   1 vs 1
    - no text of score
    - the layout of the blocks are difrrent
    - there is two paddles with different places
    - there is two balls

powerups:
-   the same for all features. Maybe just add new effects and make some fields public

Control customization:
-   just get the keys from var and not const


Multiplayer:

Main server (keep high scores, and lobbies list)
| Create new game server
|
client <- Game server -> client

each tick:
    async client -> send controls -> Game server
    async Game server -> get controls of all the players -> client
    #
    client.update(server_controls if server_controls is not None else my_controls)
    -- next tick --
    Game server -> send hash of current game tick -> client
    if client not sync (not the same hash of the game):
        Game server -> list of all the state of the game (and number of tick)
    ...

Each tick have time and id. The client get hash of the game tick and check that it have the same tick.
